        <p>Follow along as we learn about using images in HTML, adding a favicon to a website, adding SVGs to HTML,
            adding a video to a web page, and creating a table with HTML.</p>

        <section id="images">
            <h2>Adding Images to Your HTML</h2>
            <p>There are a couple of reasons for adding images to your HTML. One reason is that you would like to add an
                image for decoration. This means that if you took it off the page, the user would still be able to use
                and understand the page fully, because the image isn't adding any information they won't have otherwise.
                The other reason is because you have images that are necessary content, and if you remove them from the
                page the user would be lost or missing needed information.</p>

            <p>Images have two required attributes: <code>src</code>, which tells the browser where the image is and
                should use a relative link, and <code>alt</code>, which uses text to describe the image so that you
                could imagine what it looks like if you can't see it. Remember that if your image has any text in it,
                you have to include that in the alt text. It is also important to add the <code>height</code> and
                <code>width</code> attributes, as it improves the way your page looks as it loads. Ensure that those
                attributes are taken from the image, after editing and saving it at the correct size. Not respecting the
                aspect ratio will make your images look distorted on the screen.</p>

            <section>
                <h3><span>&#10033;&nbsp;</span> Adding Decorative Images to HTML</h3>
                <p>As explained above, a decorative images is one that if you took it off the page, the user would still
                    be able to use and understand the page fully, because the image isn't adding any information they
                    won't have otherwise. When adding these in your HTML, you indicate that they are decorative by
                    leaving the alt text attribute empty. You can't leave the alt attribute off completely, just blank.
                    Generally though, you'll add decorative images using CSS.</p>

                <!-- TO DO: add the image named square-red-blue to this section below. Be sure to add its height and width -->
                <img src="images/square-red-blue.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400">

                <h3><span>&#10033;&nbsp;</span> Adding Images as Content is HTML</h3>
                <p>For images that are content, and necessary for understanding the page (think products, maps, etc.)
                    you cannot leave the alt text blank, and should use it to describe the image to the best of your
                    ability. These should also use width and height attributes that come from the edited image itself.
                </p>

                <!-- TO DO: add the memphis recording service to this section below, I used "a neon sign hanging on a dark wall that says memphis recording service" as the alt text for this image it is 400px wide by 400px tall -->
                <img src="images/memphis-recording-service.jpg"
                    alt="neon sign in red and white that says memphis recording service" width="400" height="400">

        <section id="video">
            <h2>Adding Video to Your HTML</h2>
            <p>Many sites today use video, as it is something that audiences prefer. You can use multiple sources to
                allow the browser to play the one that it supports. This is especially handy if you are using a newer
                format, because you can also include older formats in case the user isn't in an updated browser. As with
                other resources on your site, you should use relative links for the <code>src</code> attribute.</p>

            <section>
                <h3><span>&#10033;&nbsp;</span> Using HTML5 to Add a Video</h3>
                <p>The video that we will embed below is included in the video folder of this project. Your zyBook
                    explains how these tags work in detail, but today we'll write some minimum code to get the video to
                    display on our page. Below, we'll add the video from the video folder in the project. Include the
                    attribute that will display controls for the video, and set the width.</p>

                <!-- TO DO: Add the video from the files below using HTML5 -->
                <video controls width="425">
                    <source src="video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser doesn't support this video format
                </video>

                <h3><span>&#10033;&nbsp;</span> Adding Video From YouTube</h3>
                <p>Adding a video from YouTube is as simple as copying and pasting some code. YouTube videos include
                    embed code under the share menu for each video. Once it is open, you can choose to set some options
                    or just copy the code and paste it into your HTML. YouTube uses a tag called an <code>iframe</code>
                    to hold their videos. These can render more than just videos, though, including an entire web page.
                </p>

        <section id="favicon">
            <h2>Adding a Favicon to Your Web Page</h2>
            <p>A favicon serves a lot of purposes, as you saw in our lecture today. You can find the original png that
                we will use to create our favicon inside of the images folder. You can easily convert it to a favicon
                file type on the <a href="https://www.favicon-generator.org/" target="_blank">Favicon Generator
                    website</a>. Be sure to select to only generate the 16x16 favicon with the options below the file
                upload.</p>
            <p>Please follow the instructions in class to get this working.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="svg">
            <h2>Using SVGs in HTML</h2>
            <p>There are a few ways that you can add an SVG to your page with HTML, and today we'll practice pasting
                their code directly into our HTML. You can also use a link to the file as the <code>src</code> for an
                image tag, but pasting the code allows us to do more with CSS later. Vector images are best for
                graphics, because they are defined with math, and will display perfectly at any size, which saves time
                when they load on the page.</p>
            <p>We are going to paste an SVG icon for Facebook into the footer below to practice this. Notice that I have
                added an <code>aria-label</code> attribute to the links wrapped around those icons. It is used when
                there isn't any link text, like when you wrap a link around the image.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="table">
            <h2>Using Tables in HTML</h2>
            <p>In HTML, tables are used for tabular data. Think of data similar to a schedule or what you might find
                easier to read in a spreadsheet format. Tables can cause issues on smaller screens, as they aren't
                responsive, so consider that if you add them to a page. If they will be small enough to fit on the
                screen, even with their data, you should be fine.</p>
